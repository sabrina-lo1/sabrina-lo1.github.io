## Topic - Global Impact of Fast Fashion
The term fast fashion is used to describe fashion trends that come and go very quickly. Due to the toxic chemicals and materials used to produce fast fashion the environment is being negatively impacted. The purpose of this website is to educate others on the negative impacts of fast fashion. Perhaps educating consumers on these negative effects can help slow the pace of consumption and can change people's mindsets.
