      <p id="intro1"> Fast fashion may seem simple on the outside, but there is evil hidden on the inside. Each article of clothing bought from a fast fashion retailer has an impact. Not just an impact on the world around us, but an impact on other  people living in it too. Although the inexpensive price is tempting, continuing to buy from companies that produce fast fashion will continue to enable companies to continue exploiting people and damaging the environment. Ending fast fashion may be impossible, but there are steps and factors to consider to make fast fashion more responsible.

      <p id="intro1">Buying less fast fashion is a good place to start, but is complicated because all people want to stay up to date with the trends, while saving money. We may consider buying less clothing. We can consider buying higher quality, responsibly sourced clothing made by people that are paid fairly. Perhaps educating consumers on these negative effects can help slow the pace of consumption and can change people's mindsets. Buying from more sustainable brands will also slow the pace. Although fast fashion will probably never come to an end, there are things that people can do to encourage others not to buy fast fashion.
